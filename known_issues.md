Known Issues

- Page title (city) and search bar are snapped to left and right edges of page; should be centered elegantly.
- x-axis of weather data charts does not align with the x-axis of the "date view" at the top -- the horizontal distance of one date rectangle should be exactly 24 hours, 12am to 12am.
- There is notable lag when moving the cursor along the charts, waiting for the tooltip above the orange line to render. Several text data points inside the tooltip flicker while the tooltip is moving.
